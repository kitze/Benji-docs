title: Habits
description: Build, track, and share routines without losing momentum
---

## Access & Activation

- Enable Habits from `Settings → Features → Habits`, then use the same modal to pin it to the sidebar, mobile toolbar, or toggle **Show a home widget**.
- If the page still looks hidden, refresh once and confirm the feature switch stayed on.

## Creating & Completing Habits

- Click **Create a habit** (desktop toolbar menu or mobile (+) button) to open the form. Set the name and emoji, choose a time of day, pick the days of the week (all days are preselected), and pick a color.
- Advanced options let you add a description, duration, assign the habit to a shared list teammate, switch between personal/work types, tune privacy, and set custom or punishing points (defaults are +10 for done, 0 for skip, 0 for fail). Duration powers routine planning—when you chain habits inside a routine or drop them onto the planner calendar, Benji can show exactly how long that block will take.
- Personal vs. Work toggles the habit’s category so filters and analytics reflect the right context. Privacy controls who sees your habit page or posts (default `Private`), and custom/punishing points adjust how completions influence the leaderboard.
- Mark progress by clicking the habit tile (or using the card menu for the same options):
  - A normal click marks it **Done**.
  - Hold `Alt/Option` to record a **Skip**.
  - Hold `Cmd/Ctrl` to mark it **Failed**.
  - Click again (or use the menu) to undo the entry. Week view shows the same controls for every day of the selected range, and graph view lets you click any past day to log or adjust it.
- Completing every habit in a time-of-day group unlocks a “Golden” notification with a one-click **Share on timeline** button.

## Scheduling & Planner

- Drag habits with a duration into routines to estimate total run time. Each habit’s duration rolls up into the routine length so you know how long the whole stack requires.
- You can also schedule habits directly in the planner; the duration becomes the block length on the calendar so your day view matches the time commitment.

## Views & Filters

- **Day view** groups habits by time of day, list, or score. The toolbar filters let you hide completed items, show only your own habits, or focus on habits that aren’t part of a routine. When a rest period overlaps the selected date, the board displays the rest message and gently fades the list to remind you you’re on break.
- **Week view** switches to a grid where each column is a day; the completion percentage tooltip tells you how that habit is performing and how close it is to the next grade.
- **Graph view** loads a 6‑month heat map per habit so you can spot streaks. Clicking any cell logs that day with the usual Done/Skip/Fail logic.
- If you track work and personal habits, a segmented control appears so you can view “Both”, “Personal”, or “Work” only.

## Habit Lists & Sharing

- Organise habits into lists from the sidebar. Create folders, collapse or toggle them all at once, and invite collaborators via email. Lists double as sharing boundaries—everyone you invite gains access to those habits.
- Shared list members can be assigned to habits. Open the assignment popover on any card to hand the habit to a teammate without leaving the page.
- Accept or decline list invites from the toolbar (desktop) or filters popover (mobile) so collaborators can loop you in quickly.

## Automations & AI

- Use **Generate with AI** (toolbar ••• menu) to draft a pack of suggested habits; it uses your OpenAI key if one is configured under `Settings → AI`.
- The same menu offers **Delete all habits**—handy for resets but irreversible; make sure that’s what you want before confirming.
- Golden streak notifications include a “Share on timeline” action so you can celebrate without hunting for the post composer.

## Habit Rests

- When you need downtime—vacations, recovery days, or travel—open **Habit rests** from the toolbar menu and log a rest period with start/end dates and a reason.
- Active rest periods show at the top of Day view and dim the habit list so you remember nothing is expected; habits remain intact and resume automatically when the rest ends.

## Habit Score Philosophy

- Benji avoids fragile streaks. Instead, every habit earns a letter grade based on the last 30 days so a single miss doesn’t erase progress.
- Weekly view tooltips explain your current percentage, how close you are to the next grade, and why an A+ requires zero skips.
- The **Habit Score** widget (My Day) summarises that rolling grade across all active habits so you can see improvement even after a break.

## Stats & Activity

- The stats option in the toolbar opens a 30‑day completions chart so you can review streaks and volume.
- Graph view heat maps show up to six months of activity per habit, and all of them respect the same Done/Skip/Fail logging options.

## Widgets & Dashboards

- **Habits widget**: add it from My Day (or enable **Show a home widget** in settings) to see upcoming habits. Widget settings let you show habits from collaborators, include “Any time” habits, or filter by a specific time of day. This widget also appears in the Pomodoro break modal.
- **Habit Score widget**: displays the current grade, percentage, and habit count. It’s a quick dashboard tile for spotting trends without opening the full page.
- **Summary page**: turn on `Show habits` in the summary sidebar to display a completion ring and today’s progress alongside other metrics.

## Alfred & Quick Actions

- Alfred includes a **Create a new habit** command that opens the habit form immediately.
- Spotlight actions also surface existing habits or lists, so you can jump into edits without hunting through menus.

- Each habit completion awards up to 10 points (or your custom value) in the timeline leaderboard; fails can deduct points if you set punishing values.
- Only Golden streak posts appear automatically, and they respect the Habits privacy setting (`Settings → Privacy → Habits`, default `Private`). Change the setting if you want followers or everyone to see those updates.
- Deleting or editing a habit removes its associated points entry and any shared timeline post.

## Tips & Edge Cases

- Duplicate habits from the card menu when you want a similar template with minor tweaks.
- Use keyboard modifiers (Alt to skip, Cmd/Ctrl to fail) whenever you log from day, week, graph, or My Day widgets—they all honour the same shortcuts. Prefer menus if you don’t want to use the keys.
- Apply a rest period before vacations so your score and filters don’t nag you while you’re away.
- Assign habits via shared lists to keep personal dashboards tidy—toggle “Show habits from other people” off when you only want your own responsibilities.
- Custom points and punishing points are great for gamifying accountability—just remember they directly affect the leaderboard and streak incentives.
