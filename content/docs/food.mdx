## Access & Activation

- The Food feature is part of the Benji Pro plan. Enable it from `Settings → Features → Food`, then toggle it on. From the same modal you can pin Food to the sidebar or mobile toolbar, and enable **Show a home widget** when you want a dashboard tile.
- If the Food page still hides after enabling, refresh and confirm the feature stays toggled to on in Settings before proceeding.

## Logging Meals

- Use the Food page day navigator to choose the date you’re logging for, then hit `Log food` or open the floating action button. The form prefills the selected day and supports backdating.
- The meal form adapts to your preferences: name, photo upload, time, macros, portion size, meal type, healthiness, reasons, and “aligned with goals” can all be toggled in `Settings → Features → Food → Customize food tracking form`. Every toggle is on by default.
- Each entry stores macros, on/off-path status, optional reasons, and the photo. After saving, Benji queues “Analyze with AI” in the background if you’ve connected an OpenAI key; otherwise you can trigger it manually from the meal’s menu to estimate macros, portion, healthiness, and title.
- The card menu (•••) beside every meal lets you duplicate a meal, analyze it with AI, or save it as a template for faster logging later.

## Feature Controls on the Food Page

- Toggle `Show time since last meal`, `Show food score`, `Show thumbs up/down`, and related UI switches in the Food settings popover. When enabled, Benji displays time gaps between meals, a daily score ring, and green/red alignment chips.
- The sidebar shows aggregated stats: alignment ring, food score ring, and macro totals. Macro charts appear once macros are enabled in form settings.
- Daily macro goals live in the sidebar under **Macro goals**. Each goal takes effect from its start date forward until you create a newer one, so you can adjust targets without rewriting past days.

## Templates & Macro Goals

- Templates live in the **Templates** popover (top right of the page). Selecting one opens the logging modal prefilled with its values, including on/off-path state and macros.
- Convert any logged meal into a reusable template via the card menu → **Save as a template**. Use **Analyze with AI** first if you want accurate macros copied into the template.
- Macro goals are created through the sidebar button **Create a macro goal**. You can define protein, carbs, fat, and calories targets per start date; the active goal is chosen automatically based on the day you’re viewing.

## Global Settings & Privacy

- Field-level visibility (name, image, time, macros, portion size, meal type, healthiness, reasons, alignment, score, thumbs, time-since-last-meal) all live in the `Settings → Features → Food` pane so you can tailor the form and list layout.
- Timeline visibility follows the Meals privacy control at `Settings → Privacy → Meals`. It defaults to `Private`; set it to `Followers` or `Public` to let others see Food posts in their timeline.
- AI enhancements require an OpenAI key stored under `Settings → AI`. Without a key, the analyze action safely no-ops.

## Widgets & Dashboards

- **Home dashboard**: Enable **Show a home widget** for Food in `Settings → Features → Food`, then arrange it in My Day or the dashboard layout. The widget lists today’s meals with calories and macro badges.
- **Summary page**: Flip on `Show food events` in the summary sidebar to display the Food score ring and meal count for the selected day.
- **My Day**: Add the Food widget from the My Day widget picker to see recent meals and quick actions; it links back to the Food page via the widget header.

## Alfred & Quick Actions

- Alfred always includes a `Log food` command that opens the meal form with the current date.
- Alfred also mirrors saved templates. Typing a template name runs the command, creates a meal from the template, and opens it for edits immediately.
- Default shortcuts let you open Food feature settings or pin the feature to navigation directly from Alfred.

## Timeline, Points & Privacy

- Food timeline posts are created whenever a `FoodEvent` post exists—logging from a template triggers one automatically. These posts obey the `Meals` privacy setting, so keep it on `Private` if you don’t want them to appear on the public timeline.
- Every food log awards 3 points in the timeline leaderboard (`Food log` in the point system), whether or not you share it publicly.
- Deleting a meal also removes any associated timeline post, so you can clean up the timeline by deleting or editing the underlying log.

## Tips & Edge Cases

- Turn on `Show time since last meal` to spot long gaps; Benji calculates the distance between consecutive logs in real time.
- Use duplication for recurring meals that change slightly—edit the clone before saving so you don’t overwrite the original.
- If AI analysis doesn’t populate macros, double-check that the log has a photo (for better estimates) and that your OpenAI key is valid.
- When switching macro targets mid-program, create a new macro goal with the new start date instead of editing the old one; historical days will keep their original targets.
