description: Capture meals, macros, and templates while keeping sharing under your control

## Access & Activation

- Enable the Food feature from `Settings → Features → Food`, then toggle it on. From the same modal you can pin Food to the sidebar or mobile toolbar, and enable **Show a home widget** when you want a dashboard tile.
- If the Food page still hides after enabling, refresh and confirm the feature stays toggled to on in Settings before proceeding.

## Logging Meals

- Use the Food page day navigator to choose the date you’re logging for, then hit `Log food` or open the floating action button. The form prefills the selected day and supports backdating.
- Every meal can include macros, on/off-path status, optional reasons, and photos—incoming sections explain how to slim the form down or let Benji fill in details for you.
- The card menu (•••) beside every meal lets you duplicate a meal, analyze it with AI, or save it as a template for faster logging later.

## Customize the Meal Form

- Open `Settings → Features → Food → Customize food tracking form` to choose which fields appear. Switch off whatever you don’t need (name, photo, time, macros, portion size, meal type, healthiness, reasons, “aligned with goals”) so the form stays lightweight.
- The same panel controls what shows in the list: score ring, thumbs up/down chart, and “time since last meal.” Toggling these affects both the cards and the sidebar stats immediately.

## AI Analysis

- Benji runs “Analyze with AI” in the background after each save. The job estimates macros, healthiness, and portion size, then updates the meal when results are ready.
- When the background run finishes, refresh the data with `Option/Alt + R` (or reload the page) to see the updated numbers.
- You can trigger analysis manually from the meal menu if you edited details later.
- Connect an OpenAI key in `Settings → AI` to enable these estimates; without a key the action is safely skipped.

## Templates

- Templates live in the **Templates** popover (top right). Selecting one opens the meal form prefilled with its saved values—including on-path status, macros, portion, and meal type.
- Convert any log into a reusable template via the meal menu → **Save as a template**. Run AI analysis first if you want the template to inherit estimated macros.
- Alfred mirrors these templates: summon Alfred, type the template name, press enter, and Benji instantly logs the meal (the modal opens for any quick edits).

## Macro Goals

- Create daily macro goals from the sidebar’s **Create a macro goal** button. Each goal activates on its start date and stays in effect until you add a newer goal, keeping historical days intact.
- Adjusting targets mid-program? Add a new goal with the updated date instead of editing the old one—Benji will automatically apply the correct goal to each day.
- The sidebar and macro charts reflect whichever goal is active for the date you’re viewing.

## Daily Stats & Toggles

- The sidebar shows aggregated stats: alignment ring, food score ring, and macro totals. These appear when their matching toggles are enabled in the settings popover.
- Turn on `Show time since last meal` to see how long it’s been between entries; Benji calculates the gaps in real time.

## Global Settings & Privacy

- Feature switching and field visibility all live under `Settings → Features → Food`.
- Timeline visibility follows the Meals privacy control at `Settings → Privacy → Meals`. It defaults to `Private`; switch to `Followers` or `Public` if you want meal updates to appear in other timelines.

## Widgets & Dashboards

- **Home dashboard**: Enable **Show a home widget** for Food in `Settings → Features → Food`, then arrange it in My Day or the dashboard layout. The widget lists today’s meals with calories and macro badges.
- **Summary page**: Flip on `Show food events` in the summary sidebar to display the Food score ring and meal count for the selected day.
- **My Day**: Add the Food widget from the My Day widget picker to see recent meals and quick actions; it links back to the Food page via the widget header.

## Alfred & Quick Actions

- Alfred always includes a `Log food` command that opens the meal form with the current date.
- Alfred also mirrors saved templates. Typing a template name runs the command, creates a meal from the template, and opens it for edits immediately.
- Default shortcuts let you open Food feature settings or pin the feature to navigation directly from Alfred.

## Timeline, Points & Privacy

- Benji can share meal updates automatically when you log from a template or choose to post; those updates follow the Meals privacy setting.
- Every food log awards 3 points in the timeline leaderboard (`Food log` in the point system), whether or not you share it publicly.
- Delete or edit the meal to remove its timeline entry at the same time.

## Tips & Edge Cases

- Duplicate meals for recurring favorites, then adjust before saving so the original stays intact.
- If AI analysis doesn’t populate macros, make sure the log has enough detail (ideally a photo) and that your OpenAI key is still valid, then refresh with `Option/Alt + R`.
