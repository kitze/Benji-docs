## How Feature Toggles Work

Every major feature in Benji ships disabled by default, so you can enable only the tools you need. Once you turn a feature on, it appears in your navigation and becomes available across the app‚Äîin Alfred, widgets, the sidebar, and mobile toolbars.

## Enabling a Feature

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon in the header or sidebar)
2. Navigate to **Features**
3. Find the feature you want and click its card
4. Toggle the switch to **On**
5. Choose where the feature should appear:
   - **Show in sidebar** (desktop left rail)
   - **Show in mobile toolbar** (bottom navigation on mobile)
   - **Show a home widget** (My Day dashboard tile)

After enabling, refresh the page once if the navigation doesn't update immediately. The toggle persists per user, so your settings sync across all your devices.

## Disabling a Feature

Follow the same steps above and toggle the switch to **Off**. Disabling a feature:
- Removes it from navigation and Alfred
- Hides related widgets from your dashboard
- Keeps all your data intact‚Äîre-enabling the feature restores full access

## Feature-Specific Settings

Some features include additional controls in their settings modal:
- **Default values** (e.g., pomodoro duration, hydration goal)
- **Privacy controls** (who can see timeline posts)
- **Form customization** (which fields appear when logging)
- **Automation toggles** (e.g., ambient sound auto-play during pomodoros)

Check each feature's documentation for details on what's configurable beyond the basic on/off switch.

## Widget Management

Enabling "Show a home widget" adds the feature's widget to your My Day dashboard. To rearrange or remove widgets:
- Open **My Day**
- Enter **Edit dashboard** mode (button in the header)
- Drag widgets to reorder or click the remove icon to hide them
- Save when you're done

You can also add widgets from the dashboard editor's widget picker, even if you didn't enable them during initial setup.

## Sidebar Favorites

Features you enable with "Show in sidebar" appear in the left rail on desktop. To reorder them:
- Hover over a sidebar item
- Drag the handle to rearrange
- Your order persists across sessions

Some features also support nested navigation (like Packing's sub-pages for Items, Activities, Stays, and Transports), which automatically appear when you enable the parent feature.

## Mobile Toolbar

The mobile toolbar holds up to 5 shortcuts. When you enable more than 5 features with "Show in mobile toolbar," Benji groups extras in an overflow menu. Prioritize your most-used features to keep them directly accessible.
