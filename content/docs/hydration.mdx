## What You Can Do

- Log drinks in seconds—the page prefills the active day, current time, and your default drink type so you only tweak what changed.
- Keep long-term goals intact by stacking dated goal entries; each goal takes effect from its start date forward without rewriting your past targets.
- Decide how public hydration should be: Goal completions can auto-post to the timeline, and you choose the audience in privacy settings.

## Logging Drinks

- Add entries from the hydration page, the home widget, or Alfred. Alfred surfaces your saved templates so you can log a bottle without leaving the keyboard.
- Each entry stores the amount, beverage type, optional note, and whether it should count toward today's goal.
- Coffee and tea automatically contribute 90% of their volume toward the goal. The form flags this the first time you pick those types so you understand the adjustment.
- Use the multi-select header to bulk delete or edit when you're catching up on a day's worth of logs.

## Templates and Quick Actions

- Build templates with a name, amount, type, and whether they count toward the goal. They live in the sidebar next to your daily stats.
- Selecting a template opens the logging modal prefilled with those values and the right unit, with the timestamp snapped to the day you're viewing.
- Alfred mirrors these templates: summon Alfred, start typing the template name, and hit return to log it instantly.

## Goals and Progress

- Manage hydration goals from the settings popover. Add as many goal entries as you like; the start date defines when a new target takes over, so older goals remain attached to their original periods.
- When no custom goal exists, Benji keeps you honest with a 2000 ml default.
- Progress shows up everywhere you need it: the hydration page progress bar, the summary ring (toggle via `Summary → Show hydration`), the My Day hydration widget, and the calendar overview.
- Once your weighted intake meets the active goal, Benji creates a "completed hydration goal" post (just once per day). The post inherits your hydration privacy setting, so you can keep it private, share it with followers, or make it public.
- Every hydration log is worth 2 points in the timeline leaderboard, matching the `Hydration log` entry in the point system.

## Units, Timezones, and Filtering

- Switch between milliliters and ounces at the top of the page. Benji converts everything under the hood, so your totals and goals stay in sync regardless of past entries.
- Date filters respect your current timezone, so picking “Today” or custom ranges won’t shift entries to the wrong day.
- Group the log list by beverage type or by day from the toolbar if you need to review patterns before editing.

## Widgets and Dashboards

- **Home dashboard**: Go to `Settings → Features → Hydration` and enable **Show a home widget** to pin the hydration ring to your dashboard.
- **Summary page**: Use the `Show hydration` toggle in the summary sidebar to display the hydration ring beside your other metrics.
- **My Day**: The hydration widget in My Day mirrors your goal progress and updates automatically whenever you log a drink.

## Tips

- Use the `Counts toward goal` toggle when you're logging something that shouldn't hit the daily total—perfect for celebratory drinks or supplements.
- Pair templates with Alfred if you rely on repetitive drinks (e.g., "Morning coffee 250 ml") and want to log them without touching the mouse.
- To pin the hydration widget to your home dashboard, open `Settings → Features → Hydration` and enable **Show a home widget**.
