## ✨ What It Does

Benji AI gives you a conversational assistant anywhere inside the app. Beyond meal ideas and habit drafts it can log hydration, meals, medications, pain events, and moods, keep workouts moving, and manage todos or planner events while returning the same cards the rest of Benji uses.

## 🚀 Activation

- Press `Cmd/Ctrl + I` to open the Benji AI panel from any page.
- Connect your OpenAI key under `Settings → Benji AI` if you haven't already; Benji stores the key per user so the assistant is ready on every device.
- Keep the panel pinned while you work, or close it with the same shortcut once you've copied the result.

## 🧠 Where Benji AI Helps

- **Track hydration** – log new drinks, revisit recent logs, edit amounts or types, and clear mistakes without leaving the tracker.
- **Record meals & macros** – capture food events with calories, protein, carbs, fat, healthiness, and portion details, then refine or remove them later.
- **Manage medications** – create medication entries, prescriptions, and requirements, log doses, fetch active schedules, update anything that changes, and clean up obsolete items.
- **Capture mood & symptoms** – add mood logs with notes, revise ratings, fetch past entries, or delete one-off logs; track pain events with body-part-aware logging and follow-up edits.
- **Plan the day** – add or adjust todos (including sub-tasks), reschedule planner events, cancel meetings, or list what's already on the calendar.
- **Stay organised** – pull the current tag list or project catalog so you can reference IDs when filing tasks.
- **Keep workouts moving** – see the workout that's in progress, browse available exercises, insert the right one, and log sets as you complete them.
- **Audit recent activity** – ask "what did I do yesterday?" for hydration, food, medications, pain, mood, todos, or events; fetch tools give date-bound summaries you can act on immediately.

## 💬 Response Cards & Navigation

Every successful action comes back with the same cards the rest of Benji uses (for example todo cards, planner event cards, hydration log cards). When a tool includes a related page, the assistant appends a navigation link so you can jump straight to the underlying screen.

## 💡 Prompt Ideas

- "Log 500 ml of water I just finished and show today's total."
- "Estimate macros and log tonight's salmon poke bowl with extra rice."
- "I started 400 IU Vitamin D daily; add the medication, create a morning requirement, and log the first dose."
- "Reschedule my dentist appointment to next Tuesday at 9 am and mark the todo as done."
- "Add push-ups to my current workout and log a set of 12 bodyweight reps."
- "What pain entries did I record this week? Mark the Wednesday one as 3/10 instead of 5/10."

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- If the panel warns that no AI key is configured, head to `Settings → Benji AI` and add a valid OpenAI API key.
- When responses feel off, tighten the prompt with specifics (quantities, context, or constraints) and regenerate. Benji keeps your history in the same session so you can iterate quickly.
- For edits or deletions, reference the ID from the most recent AI card or ask the assistant to list records first—fetch tools return the identifiers it needs.
