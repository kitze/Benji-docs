## ✨ What It Does

Benji AI gives you a conversational assistant anywhere inside the app. Use it to draft new habits, estimate meal nutrition, or brainstorm routines without breaking flow—the responses drop straight into the same forms you already use.

## 🚀 Activation

- Press `Cmd/Ctrl + I` to open the Benji AI panel from any page.
- Connect your OpenAI key under `Settings → Benji AI` if you haven’t already; Benji stores the key per user so the assistant is ready on every device.
- Keep the panel pinned while you work, or close it with the same shortcut once you’ve copied the result.

## 🎯 Feature-Specific Shortcuts

- **Food Tracking**  
  Ask for macro estimates or portion suggestions (e.g., “Estimate macros for a chicken burrito bowl with beans, cheese, and avocado”). After logging the meal, select **Analyze with AI** to let Benji populate macros, portion size, and healthiness automatically.

- **Habits**  
  Prompt the assistant for routine ideas (“Draft a five-day morning ritual that mixes journaling, stretching, and a quick chore”). From the Habits toolbar, pick **Generate with AI** to let Benji create habit suggestions directly on the board.

Benji AI works alongside any feature that supports freeform text, so you can capture prompts for Trips, Routines, or Journal entries, then paste the answer where you need it.

## 💡 Prompt Ideas

- “Create a one-week packing checklist for a remote work trip to Lisbon in October.”
- “Suggest three ways to make my lunchtime walk more interesting on rainy days.”
- “Summarize this journal entry into three bullet takeaways I can review later.”

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- If the panel warns that no AI key is configured, head to `Settings → Benji AI` and add a valid OpenAI API key.
- When responses feel off, tighten the prompt with specifics (quantities, context, or constraints) and regenerate. Benji keeps your history in the same session so you can iterate quickly.
