## ✨ What It Does

Finances gives you two simple ledgers—one for subscriptions, one for payment cards. Each time you sign up for a tool or add a new card, log it here so you can see what you’re paying, when renewals hit, and which card is tied to which service.

## 🚪 Access & Activation

Enable Finances from `Settings → Features → Finances`. See the [Enabling Features guide](/docs/enabling-features) for details on feature toggles and visibility options.

## 🧭 Core Workflow

- **Subscriptions page**: lists every recurring cost with amount, currency, and color-coded tiles. Use the search bar at the top to filter by name, and click **Add subscription** to log a new one.
- Subscription form fields include name, amount, color, currency, payment cadence (monthly/annual/custom), start date, status (active/paused/cancelled), and type (personal/work).
- **Cards page**: keeps track of your payment methods. Add a card with an emoji/color, last four digits, currency code, finance card type (credit/debit), and network (Visa, Mastercard, etc.).
- Each card and subscription opens in a CRUD modal for quick edits or deletion. Multi-select headers let you bulk-delete if you’re doing cleanup.

## 🛠️ In-Feature Settings

- Both lists use the Trpc CRUD modals:
  - Subscriptions support color picking so you can visually group services in the list.
  - Cards allow setting the network/type combo and storing an optional color so linked subscriptions share the same hue.
- When you edit an entry, values prefill exactly as saved, making it easy to adjust the amount or update the status after cancelling something.

## ⚡ Alfred & Quick Actions

- Spotlight (Cmd/Ctrl + K) includes:
  - **Create a new subscription** → opens the subscription form.
  - **Create a new credit card** → opens the card form.
  - **Credit cards** / **Subscriptions** quick navigation links.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd/Ctrl + K`: open Alfred to access Finances commands

## 🔗 Integrations & Dependencies

- Subscription records can reference a card (`cardId`), letting you match recurring charges to the payment method you’re using.
- Currency formatting uses the stored currency code, so make sure to set it correctly when you create a subscription.

## 💡 Tips & Edge Cases

- Use colors to mirror card + subscription relationships (e.g., all subscriptions billed to one card share the same color).
- Update the status to **Paused** or **Cancelled** when you negotiate a hold—keeping old entries around helps you remember what you already tried.
- Multi-select (via the checkboxes that appear after you select one tile) is handy when you need to delete several outdated cards or subscriptions at once.
