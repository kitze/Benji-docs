## ✨ What It Does

The Fasting feature helps you track intermittent fasting periods with real-time countdowns, automatic streak calculations, and flexible goal setting. Start a fast with a single tap, watch your progress through a visual ring display, and build momentum with streak tracking that rewards consistency. Fasting data integrates into your dashboard widgets, timeline posts, and summary views, giving you a complete picture of your fasting routine without manual calculations or spreadsheets.

## 🚪 Access & Activation

Enable Fasting from `Settings → Features → Fasting` and link to the [Enabling Features guide](/docs/enabling-features).

## 🧭 Core Workflow

**Starting a Fast:**
- Tap "Start a fast" from the main Fasting page or My Day dashboard widget

**During a Fast:**
- View live countdown in widgets showing hours and minutes remaining
- Check progress ring that fills as you approach your goal
- See your current streak displayed with a flame icon
- Access from dashboard widgets, sidebar, or header bar

**Ending a Fast:**
- Tap "End" on any fasting widget or the main page
- The app calculates your total fasting duration

## ⚡ Alfred & Quick Actions

For general Alfred/Spotlight usage, see the [Alfred & Spotlight guide](/docs/alfred-spotlight).

**Fasting-Specific Actions:**
- Open Alfred (`⌘K` or `Cmd+K`)
- Type "Settings → Fasting" to access feature settings
- Navigate directly to `/my/fasts` by typing "fasting" in Alfred

The Fasting feature uses the main UI for starting and ending fasts rather than Alfred commands—tap "Start a fast" or "End" buttons on the dashboard or Fasting page.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

The Fasting feature primarily uses on-screen buttons and widgets rather than dedicated keyboard shortcuts.

**Related Global Shortcuts:**
- `⌘K` (Cmd+K): Open Alfred/Spotlight to navigate to Fasting page
- `⌘B` (Cmd+B): Toggle sidebar to show/hide the fasting sidebar widget

## 🏆 Timeline, Points & Privacy

**Timeline Posts:**

When you **start a fast**, an automatic post is created:
- Format: "I'm starting a [X]hr fast! 🥳"
- Default audience: Private
- Editing the fast updates the timeline post

When you **complete a fast**:
- **Success** (duration ≥ goal): "I completed a [X]hr [Y]min fast! 🎉"
- **Incomplete** (duration < goal): "I failed to complete my [X]hr fast after [Y]hr [Z]min 😞"
- Default audience: Private
- Awards 5 points on completion (regardless of success)

**Point Value:**
- Completing a fast: **5 points**
- Points are awarded when you end a fast, not when you start
- No bonus points for exceeding your goal

**Privacy Settings:**
- Navigate to `Settings → Privacy → Fasting`
- Default: **Private** (only you see your posts)
- Change to **Followers Only** to share with your followers
- Change to **Everyone** for fully public posts
- Privacy setting applies to both start and completion posts

**Public Fasting Users:**
- If your fasting privacy is set to Everyone, you appear in the "Public Fasting Users" list
- This shows the 10 most recent active fasts (within 72 hours)
- Other users can see your fasting activity on your profile

## 🔗 Integrations & Dependencies

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Fasting widgets appear on the My Day dashboard when the feature is enabled

**Timeline & Social:**
- Fasting posts appear in your personal timeline

- A fast must meet or exceed 14 hours to maintain your streak
- Missing a day or completing a fast under 14 hours resets the streak
- Current streak displays on My Day widget and main Fasting page

**Timezone Handling:**
- All fasting times respect your account timezone setting

## 💡 Tips & Edge Cases

**Building Consistent Streaks:**
- Set realistic goals—14+ hours counts toward streaks

- Incomplete fasts still appear in your history and timeline
- Edit past fasts if you forgot to end them at the correct time

**Multiple Fasts Per Day:**
- You can only have one active fast at a time
- After ending a fast, start a new one whenever you're ready
- Each fast is tracked separately in your monthly view

**Goal Flexibility:**
- Override your default goal at start time for special occasions
- Longer goals (e.g., 24-48 hours) work for extended fasts
- Maximum goal: 168 hours (one week)

**Editing Historical Data:**

- Useful if you forgot to end a fast or logged incorrect times
- Editing updates timeline posts automatically

**Widget Visibility:**
- If widgets aren't showing, check that Fasting is enabled in `Settings → Features`
- Sidebar and header widgets only appear during active fasts
- My Day widget can be removed/re-added in dashboard customization settings

**Privacy for Beginners:**
