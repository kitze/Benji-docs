## ✨ What It Does

Locations is a memory book for the spots that matter—favorite cafés, client offices, gyms. It shows when you were last there, lets you tag who’s connected to the place, and gives you a fast way to record the next visit so nothing slips through the cracks.

## 🚪 Access & Activation

- Enable Locations from `Settings → Features → Locations`. Turn it on to surface the page in the sidebar or mobile toolbar.
- Refresh once after toggling if the navigation doesn’t update; each user controls their own visibility.

## 🧭 Core Workflow

- Open the Locations page to see every place grouped by how recently you were there (Today, Yesterday, last 7 days, and so on down to Never Visited).
- Use the search bar (desktop) or the sticky header (mobile) to filter by name when the list gets long.
- Click **New Location** (desktop) or the floating `＋` button (mobile) to add a place. Give it a name, emoji, optional address and note, and you’re set.
- Select any card to open a details modal with the last visit timestamp and quick edit options.
- Log a visit right from the card menu: **Log Today**, **Log Yesterday**, or **Log Visit** (which opens the Activity Log form if you need notes or to attach multiple locations at once).

## 🛠️ In-Feature Settings

- The creation form supports:
  - Emoji + name (required) so cards are easy to scan.
  - Contact links—attach one or more contacts to note who you usually meet there.
  - Address and free-form notes for context like door codes.
  - `Parent location` when you want a hierarchy (e.g., “HQ → Board Room”).
- Edit or delete a place from the entity menu on the card or in the details modal.

## 🔐 Global Settings & Privacy

- Visit logging runs through Activity Logs, so sharing and privacy follow the same rules—you decide when to share a log and timelines stay untouched until you do.

## 📊 Widgets & Dashboards

- Visits surface in Activity widgets because they’re logged through Activity Logs.

## ⚡ Alfred & Quick Actions

- Spotlight lists existing locations (enable the feature first), making it easy to jump into a card from the command palette.
- Use the page button or the entity menu to add new places when you’re not already in Spotlight.
- Use the card menu’s quick actions when you need to log today or yesterday without opening a form.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd/Ctrl + K`: open Spotlight to jump to an existing location or run actions like **Create a new location** / **Log visit** from anywhere.

## 🏆 Timeline & Points

- Visits are stored as Activity Logs, award +1 leaderboard point (`Activity log` in the point system), and update your recency view while leaving timelines untouched.

## 🔗 Integrations & Dependencies

- Activity Logs can reference multiple locations in one entry, so a single visit can update several cards at once.
- Trips can link to locations (the Prisma model associates them), making it easier to reuse destinations when planning travel.
- Linked contacts gain extra context—when you view a contact, the Activity Log list can show joint visits because both the location and the contact are attached to the same log.

## 💡 Tips & Edge Cases

- Use parent locations to group rooms or buildings; the form prevents loops, so you can safely build multi-level hierarchies.
- When you’re logging a visit manually, include notes in the Activity Log so the Location details modal shows richer history.
- If you manage a recurring route, log the visit from the card menu on mobile—the Log Today/Yesterday quick actions run instantly and keep your recency groups accurate.
