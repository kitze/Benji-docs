## ✨ What It Does

Food Tracking is the daily food journal you’ll actually keep. It lets you jot down what you ate, snap a quick photo if you have one, and see how those meals stack up against the targets you care about—no spreadsheet or calorie math required.

## 🚪 Access & Activation

Enable Food from `Settings → Features → Food`. See the [Enabling Features guide](/docs/enabling-features) for details on feature toggles and visibility options.

## 🧭 Core Workflow

- Use the Food page day navigator to choose the date you’re logging for, then hit `Log food` or open the floating action button. The form prefills the selected day and supports backdating.
- Every meal can include macros, on/off-path status, optional reasons, and photos—incoming sections explain how to slim the form down or let Benji fill in details for you.
- The card menu (•••) beside every meal lets you duplicate a meal, analyze it with AI, or save it as a template for faster logging later.

## 🛠️ In-Feature Settings

- Open `Settings → Features → Food → Customize food tracking form` to choose which fields appear. Switch off whatever you don’t need (name, photo, time, macros, portion size, meal type, healthiness, reasons, “aligned with goals”) so the form stays lightweight.
- The same panel controls what shows in the list: score ring, thumbs up/down chart, and “time since last meal.” Toggling these affects both the cards and the sidebar stats immediately.
- Templates live in the **Templates** popover (top right). Selecting one opens the meal form prefilled with its saved values—including on-path status, macros, portion, and meal type. Convert any log into a reusable template via the meal menu → **Save as a template**.
- Create daily macro goals from the sidebar’s **Create a macro goal** button. Each goal activates on its start date and stays in effect until you add a newer goal, keeping historical days intact. Adjusting targets mid-program? Add a new goal instead of editing the old one so Benji preserves history.
- The sidebar stats—alignment ring, food score ring, macro totals, and “time since last meal”—mirror whichever toggles you enable in this settings panel.

## 🔐 Global Settings & Privacy

- Feature switching and field visibility all live under `Settings → Features → Food`.
- Timeline visibility follows the Meals privacy control at `Settings → Privacy → Meals`. It defaults to `Private`; switch to `Followers` or `Public` if you want meal updates to appear in other timelines.

## 📊 Widgets & Dashboards

- **Home dashboard**: Enable **Show a home widget** for Food in `Settings → Features → Food`, then arrange it in My Day or the dashboard layout. The widget lists today’s meals with calories and macro badges.
- **Summary page**: Flip on `Show food events` in the summary sidebar to display the Food score ring and meal count for the selected day.
- **My Day**: Add the Food widget from the My Day widget picker to see recent meals and quick actions; it links back to the Food page via the widget header.

## ⚡ Alfred & Quick Actions

Learn more about Alfred in the [Alfred & Spotlight guide](/docs/alfred-spotlight).

- **Log food**: opens the meal form with the current date
- Saved templates appear as quick actions—type a template name to create a meal from it instantly

## 🤖 Benji AI

- Activate Benji AI with `Cmd/Ctrl + I`, then ask something like “Estimate macros for a grilled salmon bowl with quinoa, spinach, and feta” to get protein, carb, and fat targets you can paste into the meal form.
- After saving a meal, choose **Analyze with AI** from the card menu to have Benji fill macros, portion size, and healthiness automatically; refresh with `Option/Alt + R` if you want to pull in the updated numbers immediately.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd/Ctrl + K`: open Alfred to access Food commands
- `Option/Alt + R`: refresh the Food page after an AI analysis finishes to pull in the updated macros

## 🏆 Timeline & Points

- Benji can share meal updates automatically when you log from a template or choose to post; those updates follow the Meals privacy setting.
- Every food log awards 3 points in the timeline leaderboard (`Food log` in the point system), whether or not you share it publicly.
- Delete or edit the meal to remove its timeline entry at the same time.

## 🔗 Integrations & Dependencies

- Macro goals and food score data surface across Benji: the Summary page ring, My Day widget tiles, and the timeline leaderboard all reuse the same underlying totals.
- Planner events that reference meals respect the same privacy and point rules, so keeping your settings tidy ensures downstream widgets stay accurate.
- Templates and AI analysis rely on shared services (OpenAI keys, template storage), so confirm those integrations before troubleshooting missing data.

## 💡 Tips & Edge Cases

- Duplicate meals for recurring favorites, then adjust before saving so the original stays intact.
- If AI analysis doesn’t populate macros, make sure the log has enough detail (ideally a photo) and that your OpenAI key is still valid, then refresh with `Option/Alt + R`.
