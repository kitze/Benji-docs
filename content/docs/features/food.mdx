title: "🍽️ Food Tracking"
description: Capture meals, macros, and templates while keeping sharing under your control
---

## 🚪 Access & Activation

- Enable the Food feature from `Settings → Features → Food`, then toggle it on. From the same modal you can pin Food to the sidebar or mobile toolbar, and enable **Show a home widget** when you want a dashboard tile.
- If the Food page still hides after enabling, refresh and confirm the feature stays toggled to on in Settings before proceeding.

## 🧭 Core Workflow

- Use the Food page day navigator to choose the date you’re logging for, then hit `Log food` or open the floating action button. The form prefills the selected day and supports backdating.
- Every meal can include macros, on/off-path status, optional reasons, and photos—incoming sections explain how to slim the form down or let Benji fill in details for you.
- The card menu (•••) beside every meal lets you duplicate a meal, analyze it with AI, or save it as a template for faster logging later.

## 🛠️ In-Feature Settings

- Open `Settings → Features → Food → Customize food tracking form` to choose which fields appear. Switch off whatever you don’t need (name, photo, time, macros, portion size, meal type, healthiness, reasons, “aligned with goals”) so the form stays lightweight.
- The same panel controls what shows in the list: score ring, thumbs up/down chart, and “time since last meal.” Toggling these affects both the cards and the sidebar stats immediately.
- Templates live in the **Templates** popover (top right). Selecting one opens the meal form prefilled with its saved values—including on-path status, macros, portion, and meal type. Convert any log into a reusable template via the meal menu → **Save as a template**.
- Create daily macro goals from the sidebar’s **Create a macro goal** button. Each goal activates on its start date and stays in effect until you add a newer goal, keeping historical days intact. Adjusting targets mid-program? Add a new goal instead of editing the old one so Benji preserves history.
- The sidebar stats—alignment ring, food score ring, macro totals, and “time since last meal”—mirror whichever toggles you enable in this settings panel.

## 🤖 Automation & AI

- Benji runs “Analyze with AI” in the background after each save. The job estimates macros, healthiness, and portion size, then updates the meal when results are ready.
- When the background run finishes, refresh the data with `Option/Alt + R` (or reload the page) to see the updated numbers.
- You can trigger analysis manually from the meal menu if you edited details later.
- Connect an OpenAI key in `Settings → AI` to enable these estimates; without a key the action is safely skipped.

## 🔐 Global Settings & Privacy

- Feature switching and field visibility all live under `Settings → Features → Food`.
- Timeline visibility follows the Meals privacy control at `Settings → Privacy → Meals`. It defaults to `Private`; switch to `Followers` or `Public` if you want meal updates to appear in other timelines.

## 📊 Widgets & Dashboards

- **Home dashboard**: Enable **Show a home widget** for Food in `Settings → Features → Food`, then arrange it in My Day or the dashboard layout. The widget lists today’s meals with calories and macro badges.
- **Summary page**: Flip on `Show food events` in the summary sidebar to display the Food score ring and meal count for the selected day.
- **My Day**: Add the Food widget from the My Day widget picker to see recent meals and quick actions; it links back to the Food page via the widget header.

## ⚡ Alfred & Quick Actions

- Alfred always includes a `Log food` command that opens the meal form with the current date.
- Alfred also mirrors saved templates. Typing a template name runs the command, creates a meal from the template, and opens it for edits immediately—perfect for the repetitive meals you captured in the templates popover.
- Default shortcuts let you open Food feature settings or pin the feature to navigation directly from Alfred.

## 🏆 Timeline & Points

- Benji can share meal updates automatically when you log from a template or choose to post; those updates follow the Meals privacy setting.
- Every food log awards 3 points in the timeline leaderboard (`Food log` in the point system), whether or not you share it publicly.
- Delete or edit the meal to remove its timeline entry at the same time.

## 🔗 Integrations & Dependencies

- Macro goals and food score data surface across Benji: the Summary page ring, My Day widget tiles, and the timeline leaderboard all reuse the same underlying totals.
- Planner events that reference meals respect the same privacy and point rules, so keeping your settings tidy ensures downstream widgets stay accurate.
- Templates and AI analysis rely on shared services (OpenAI keys, template storage), so confirm those integrations before troubleshooting missing data.

## 💡 Tips & Edge Cases

- Duplicate meals for recurring favorites, then adjust before saving so the original stays intact.
- If AI analysis doesn’t populate macros, make sure the log has enough detail (ideally a photo) and that your OpenAI key is still valid, then refresh with `Option/Alt + R`.
