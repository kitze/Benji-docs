## ✨ What It Does

Trips turns Benji into a lightweight travel cockpit. Create a trip with dates, transports, stays, and relevant activities, then let Benji generate packing tasks, track charging prep, and link project plans so every departure feels buttoned up.

## 🚪 Access & Activation

- Enable Trips from `Settings → Features → Trips` to expose the **Trips** page (and companion **Stays**/**Transports** sections) in the sidebar and mobile toolbar.
- After toggling, refresh once if the navigation hasn’t updated yet—visibility persists per user.

## 🧭 Core Workflow

- Open the Trips list to see future and past travel grouped by time. Use the search bar or grouping dropdown to filter.
- Click **Add Trip** to launch the trip form. You can:
  - Name the trip and set location, start/end dates.
  - Attach existing packing activities, projects, stays, and transports.
  - Flag whether you’re staying at your own place or using your own transport.
- Each card shows booking status badges (inbound/outbound transport and stay) and the date range at a glance. Use the card menu to edit, duplicate, or delete.
- Open any trip to land in the travel dashboard: timeline pills for stays/transports, packing progress, charging board, and linked projects.

## 🛠️ In-Feature Settings

- The trip form supports multi-select pickers that pull from existing data:
  - **Activities** determine which packing items auto-load when you “Start packing.”
  - **Projects** attach TODO projects to the trip—handy for itinerary checklists.
  - **Stays/Transports** prefill the timeline pills so you see the agenda at a glance.
- Trip detail menu actions include:
  - **Create a new project** or **Create a project from template** scoped to the trip.
  - **Start packing**, **Refresh packing items**, **Sync with packing lists**, or **Start packing from scratch** once you’re adjusting checklists.
- The packing board filters (Show packed items, Show charging items, Show items planned for the morning) persist per user so you can focus on what matters during prep.

## ⚡ Alfred & Quick Actions

- Spotlight (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`) exposes:
  - **Create a new trip** → opens the form immediately.
  - Navigation shortcuts to **Trips**, **Stays**, **Transports**, and packing activity/item screens.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd/Ctrl + K`: open Spotlight to create a trip or jump straight to the Trips page.

## 🏆 Timeline & Points

- Trips keep the public timeline and leaderboard unchanged—they act as organisational overlays on top of your packing and project data.

## 🔗 Integrations & Dependencies

- “Start packing” seeds the list with all **essential** packing items plus items tied to the trip’s selected activities.
- The charging board pulls any packing item marked “Needs charging” and tracks status across **Not charged**, **Charging**, and **Charged** columns.
- Linked projects render directly in the trip view, so you can manage trip-specific TODOs alongside packing progress.
- Planner views can show trips (see `getTripsForPlanner`) so calendar mode reflects travel windows.

## 💡 Tips & Edge Cases

- Keep transports and stays updated—those pills double as quick-edit shortcuts for rebooking.
- Use “Sync with packing lists” after you add new essential items so existing trips pick them up without a reset.
- When you’re finished packing, “Start packing from scratch” clears statuses for the next outing while keeping the trip data intact.
