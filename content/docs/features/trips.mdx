## ✨ What It Does

Trips turns Benji into a lightweight travel cockpit. Create a trip with dates, transports, stays, and relevant activities, then let Benji generate packing tasks, track charging prep, and link project plans so every departure feels buttoned up.

## 🚪 Access & Activation

- Enable Trips from `Settings → Features → Trips` to expose the **Trips** page (and companion **Stays**/**Transports** sections) in the sidebar and mobile toolbar.
- After toggling, refresh once if the navigation hasn’t updated yet—visibility persists per user.

## 🧭 Core Workflow

- Open the Trips list to review upcoming, in-progress, and past travel grouped by timeframe. Filter with the search bar or grouping dropdown when the list grows.
- Click **Add Trip** to launch the form:
  - Set name, destination, start/end dates, and whether you’re staying at your own place or using your own transport.
  - Attach [packing activities](../packing/activities), [stays](../packing/stays), [transports](../packing/transports), and relevant projects so the dashboard is fully populated on first load.
- Saved trips flip into cards showing travel dates plus booking indicators for linked stays and transports. Use the ••• menu to edit, duplicate, or delete.
- Opening a trip drops you into the travel dashboard where the timeline, packing board, charging queue, and linked projects live side by side.

## 🛠️ In-Feature Settings

- Multi-select pickers in the form pull from your existing data:
  - **Activities** seed the packing list with the right gear templates.
  - **Projects** attach full todo roadmaps to the trip for checklists and follow-up tasks.
  - **Stays** and **Transports** prefill the travel timeline so you can see the agenda at a glance.
- Trip menu actions let you:
  - Spin up a fresh project or project template scoped to the trip.
  - Run packing commands: **Start packing**, **Refresh packing items**, **Sync with packing lists**, or **Start packing from scratch** when you need a clean slate.
- Packing board filters (Show packed items, Show charging items, Show items planned for the morning) persist per user, keeping the view tuned to what you care about.

## 🗺️ Trip Dashboard Surfaces

- **Travel timeline**: horizontal pills for inbound/outbound transports and stays with quick-edit affordances. Booking badges mirror the status of the underlying records.
- **Packing board**: groups items by “Needs packing,” “Packed,” and “Morning of” with quick toggles for charging status.
- **Charging board**: focuses solely on items flagged **Needs charging**, tracking progression from Not charged → Charging → Charged.
- **Projects panel**: displays any linked projects with progress rings so you can work through travel-specific todos without leaving the page.
- **Quick links**: shortcuts to create new stays, transports, or packing activities without navigating away.

## ⚡ Alfred & Quick Actions

- Spotlight (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`) exposes:
  - **Create a new trip** → opens the form immediately.
  - Navigation shortcuts to **Trips**, **Stays**, **Transports**, and packing activity/item screens.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd/Ctrl + K`: open Spotlight to create a trip or jump straight to the Trips page.

## 🔗 Integrations & Dependencies

- “Start packing” pulls in every **Essential** item plus gear linked to the trip’s chosen [packing activities](../packing/activities).
- The charging board reads charging status directly from your [packing items](../packing), so updating it in either place keeps both in sync.
- Linked projects surface in the dashboard and feed the global leaderboard via their tasks—use them for itineraries, shopping lists, or post-trip follow-up.
- Trips surface across Planner (`getTripsForPlanner`) so travel windows block out calendar space and inform Weekly planning.
- Stays and transports you edit from the trip view update the same records shown on their dedicated pages, preventing duplicate data entry.

## 💡 Tips & Edge Cases

- Keep transports and stays updated—those pills double as quick-edit shortcuts for rebooking.
- Use “Sync with packing lists” after you add new essential items so existing trips pick them up without a reset.
- When you’re finished packing, “Start packing from scratch” clears statuses for the next outing while keeping the trip data intact.
