## ✨ What It Does

Ambient Sounds gives you a lightweight soundboard built into Benji. Dial in rain, fire, wind—or a rotating lofi track—and keep the mix running while you write, plan, or run a pomodoro without juggling another tab.

## 🚪 Access & Activation

- Enable the feature in `Settings → Features → Ambient Sounds`. Once it’s on, you’ll see the music note widget in the sidebar and the My Day dashboard.

## 🧭 Core Workflow

- Click the music note in the header, sidebar widget, My Day widget, or hit `Alt + A` to open the Ambient Sound Manager.
- Use **Master Controls** to start/stop playback and adjust the global volume.
- Toggle any sound tile (Rain, Fire, Waves, Birds, etc.) to layer it into the mix; each tile has its own volume slider and animated feedback when active.
- Shuffle the selection with the dice icon—Benji randomly picks a few sounds, sets pleasant volumes, and starts the mix.
- Switch on the **Lofi Player** if you want a melodic background; shuffle the track or adjust its volume without leaving the modal.

## 🛠️ In-Feature Settings

- Master controls live at the top: play/pause, master volume slider, and (when available) the lofi mini player.
- Each sound tile includes:
  - Tap-to-toggle enable/disable.
  - Per-sound volume slider.
  - Visual animation so you can see which layers are active.
- Use the shuffle actions to rotate ambient layers or lofi tracks automatically.
- Under `Settings → Pomodoros`, enable **“Toggle ambient sound when starting or ending a pomodoro.”** Benji will start your mix when a session begins and mute it when you finish.

## 🔐 Global Settings & Privacy

- Ambient audio is strictly local—no privacy controls or timeline posts are involved.
- Desktop notifications let you know when the quick toggle runs (`Ambient sound on/off`) so you always know the current state.

## 📊 Widgets & Dashboards

- **Sidebar widget (left rail):** shows current state and opens the Ambient Sound Manager with one click.
- **My Day “Ambient” widget:** surfaces the same controls—active sounds, play/pause toggle, and master volume slider—inside your dashboard layout.

## ⚡ Alfred & Quick Actions

- Spotlight includes **“Ambient sounds”** so you can open the manager without touching the mouse (feature flag must be enabled).
- The Music widget’s action button and the sidebar widget both open the manager, making the control panel two clicks away from anywhere.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Alt + A`: open the Ambient Sound dialog from anywhere.
- `Alt + M`: toggle the entire ambient mix on/off.
- `Cmd/Ctrl + K`: open Spotlight to jump to the **Ambient sounds** action without leaving your current context.

## 🔗 Integrations & Dependencies

- Pomodoro sessions can auto-toggle the mix when you start or end a timer.
- Usage checklist (“Try ambient sounds”) nudges new users to open the manager once.
- Ambient playback runs through the `AmbientSoundPlayer`, so closing the tab or signing out stops the audio automatically.

## 💡 Tips & Edge Cases

- Layer two or three sounds at modest volumes instead of cranking one channel—it feels richer and avoids fatigue.
- Use the shuffle button when you’re unsure what to play; it intelligently picks a handful of complementary textures.
- Remember the keyboard shortcuts (`Alt + M`, `Alt + A`) when you need to mute quickly for calls or switch contexts.
