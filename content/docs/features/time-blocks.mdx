## ‚ú® What It Does

Time Blocks help you organize your day by creating dedicated time periods for specific types of work. Instead of just listing todos, you can group them into focused sessions like "Morning Focus," "Team Meetings," or "Creative Work." Each time block shows you exactly how much time you've allocated versus how much you have available, with visual progress bars that warn you when you're trying to fit too much into a single block. This makes it easy to plan realistic days, avoid over-scheduling, and maintain dedicated focus time for different activities.

## üö™ Access & Activation

Time Blocks are always available in your planner‚Äîno feature flag required. Just open your planner and select "Time block" when creating a new event.

## üß≠ Core Workflow

### Creating a Time Block

1. Navigate to **My Day ‚Üí Planner**
2. Click any time slot in the calendar
3. In the event type dropdown at the top, select **Time block**
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Name**: Give your block a descriptive title (e.g., "Morning Focus Session")
   - **Emoji** (optional): Add a visual icon for quick identification
   - **Start time**: When the block begins
   - **End time**: When the block ends
   - **Recurrence** (optional): Set the block to repeat daily, weekly, monthly, or custom
5. Click **Create time block**

Your time block appears in the calendar spanning the scheduled duration, displaying the name and emoji you chose.

### Adding Todos to Time Blocks

Switch to **My Day ‚Üí Today** and enable grouping by time block:

1. Click the **Filters** icon (funnel) in the toolbar
2. Under "Display," find the **Group by** dropdown
3. Select **Time block**

Now you can add todos directly to each block:

- Click the **+** button next to a time block name, or
- Type in the "Add todo to [Time Block Name]" field
- Press Enter to create the todo

You can also assign existing todos by editing them and selecting a time block from the dropdown.

### Moving and Organizing Todos

- **Drag and drop** todos between time blocks in the My Day view
- **Remove from block**: Edit a todo and clear the time block field‚Äîit moves to "Todos not in a time block"
- **Bulk select**: Click "Select all" within a time block for batch operations

### Editing Time Blocks

- **Quick name edit**: In My Day view, click the time block name to edit it inline
- **Full edit**: Click the time block in the planner, select "Time block" from the event type dropdown, then update name, emoji, or recurrence
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon next to the time block name. **Important**: Deleting a time block doesn't delete the todos‚Äîthey remain as standalone tasks

### Duplicating Time Blocks

Right-click a time block in the planner and select **Duplicate**. A dialog asks whether to include todos:

- **Do not include**: Creates an empty duplicate with the same name/time
- **Include**: Copies all todos from the original block

This is perfect for repeating weekly patterns or sprint planning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings Inside the Feature

### Inline Name Editing

Click any time block name in the My Day view to rename it immediately‚Äîchanges save automatically.

### Recurrence Patterns

When creating or editing a time block, choose from:

- **Daily**: Repeats every day
- **Weekly**: Repeats on the same day each week
- **Bi-weekly**: Every two weeks
- **Monthly**: Same day each month
- **Custom**: Define your own pattern using advanced recurrence rules

Each instance of a recurring time block is independent. Recurring blocks don't automatically copy todos‚Äîuse the duplicate function when you need the same todos in multiple instances.

## üìä Widgets & Dashboards

### My Day View (Grouped by Time Block)

When you group todos by time block in My Day, each block displays:

- **Block header**: Name, emoji, and time range
- **Progress bar**: Shows allocated time versus total capacity
  - **Violet section**: Time allocated to todos (based on todo durations)
  - **Gray section**: Remaining unallocated time
  - **Red bar**: Appears when total todo duration exceeds the time block‚Äîyou're over capacity!
- **Quick actions**: Add todos, select all, or delete the block

Todos without a time block appear in a separate section at the top.

### Planner Calendar View

Time blocks appear as colored blocks spanning their scheduled duration. Click any block to:

- View details
- Edit properties
- Duplicate (with or without todos)
- Delete
- Adjust timing with quick move presets (+15m, -15m, etc.)

### Capacity Planning

Set estimated durations on your todos (in minutes or hours). The time block progress bar automatically updates to show:

- **"1h 30m / 1h left"**: Example showing 1.5 hours allocated, 1 hour remaining
- **Red progress bar**: Warning that you've scheduled more work than the time block allows

This visual feedback helps you plan realistic days and avoid overcommitting.

## üîó Integrations & Dependencies

### Planner Integration

Time blocks are a special type of planner event that appear alongside regular events, habits, and routines. They integrate seamlessly with the planner's:

- Monthly, weekly, daily, and agenda views
- Calendar context menus (right-click actions)
- Recurrence system for repeating patterns
- Zoom controls and list toggles

### Todo Integration

Any todo can be assigned to a time block via:

- The **Time block** dropdown when creating or editing todos
- Quick add fields within time blocks in the My Day view
- Drag-and-drop in the My Day view (when grouped by time block)

Todos track their estimated duration, which feeds into the time block's capacity calculations.

### List Sharing

If you share planner lists with other users, they can see time blocks according to standard planner sharing permissions. There are no time-block-specific privacy controls.

## üí° Tips & Edge Cases

### Planning Your Day

Create recurring time blocks for your typical daily structure (e.g., "Morning Focus" 8-10 AM, "Meetings" 2-4 PM, "Admin Work" 4-5 PM). Each morning, switch My Day to "Group by Time Block" and quickly fill in the todos for each session.

### Sprint Planning

Create a single time block for a sprint period, add all sprint tasks with durations, then duplicate the block (including todos) to future sprint dates. Customize each iteration's todos as needed.

### Avoid Over-Scheduling

If a progress bar turns **red**, you've scheduled more work than fits in the time block. Either:

- Reduce todo durations
- Remove some todos from the block
- Extend the time block's end time

### Deleting Doesn't Lose Work

Deleting a time block only removes the container‚Äîall todos inside remain as regular tasks in your "Todos not in a time block" section.

### Duplicating for Consistency

Use the duplicate function to create consistent meeting prep blocks. For example, duplicate "Team Standup Prep" every Monday, choosing to include todos each time for a pre-filled checklist.

### No Automatic Refresh

When you edit a time block's name or emoji, the change may not immediately appear in all views. Refresh the page to see updates reflected everywhere.

### Time Slot Flexibility

Unlike fixed appointments, you can quickly adjust time blocks by right-clicking and using move presets (shift forward/backward 15 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.) without re-entering times manually.
