## ✨ What It Does

Journal gives you a quiet space to write—whether you’re logging a quick gratitude list or a full retrospective. Entries stay organized by month, templates keep prompts handy, and optional encryption makes sure private thoughts stay private.

## 🚪 Access & Activation

Enable Journal from `Settings → Features → Journal`. See the [Enabling Features guide](/docs/enabling-features) for details on feature toggles and visibility options.

Encryption is opt-in. Open the lock icon in the desktop header (or the same section in Settings) to turn it on, set a reminder, and store the key on your device.

## 🧭 Core Workflow

- Browse months with the header navigator or the calendar in the sidebar; entries are grouped by day with an at-a-glance word count.
- Click **Write** (desktop) or the floating pencil (mobile) to start an entry. The editor autosaves to local storage, tracks word goals, and lets you adjust the date if you’re backfilling.
- Open any card to edit in-place. Hold `Cmd/Ctrl` while clicking to multi-select when you’re planning bulk actions.
- Use the template shelf to drop in a favorite prompt or a platform starter entry—it opens the create modal prefilled with that content.

## 🛠️ In-Feature Settings

- Entry form controls:
  - Date picker with big calendar tile for quick backdating.
  - Title field (fancy font) and rich text body with toolbar shortcuts.
  - Optional word goal badge you can toggle or tweak per device.
- Entry menus support rename, delete, and encryption toggles (`Mark as Encrypted/Unencrypted`, Encrypt Content, Decrypt).
- The floating bulk toolbar appears when you select multiple entries—use it to mark as encrypted, decrypt, or delete in batches.

## 🔐 Global Settings & Privacy

- The encryption widget in the desktop header manages the master switch. When encryption is on, you **must** store the key locally; we never keep it on the server.
- Lose the key and encrypted entries stay unreadable—use the password reminder field to set a hint you’ll remember.
- Some features (Journal and Affirmations) share the same encryption setting, so flipping it affects both.
- Journal entries stay private unless you share them manually.

## 📊 Widgets & Dashboards

- Add the **Journal Stats** widget from the My Day editor to surface total entries, month counts, word totals, and your active streak. Each stat can be toggled on/off in widget settings.

## ⚡ Alfred & Quick Actions

Learn more about Alfred in the [Alfred & Spotlight guide](/docs/alfred-spotlight).

- **Create a new journal entry**: opens the full Journal page
- **Create a quick journal entry**: opens the modal for quick capture without leaving your current view

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd/Ctrl + K`: open Alfred to access Journal commands
- `Cmd/Ctrl + click` on an entry card to multi-select it for bulk encryption or deletion

## 🏆 Timeline & Points

- Every entry contributes +2 points to the leaderboard (`Journal entry` in the point system).
- Entries stay private by default; share links manually if you want peers to read them.

## 🔗 Integrations & Dependencies

- Encryption settings apply globally, so once you flip the switch, other encrypted features (like Affirmations) expect the same key.
- Journal Stats widget pulls from the TRPC stats endpoint—the same data powers the sidebar stats in the Journal page.
- The month navigator and calendar share the selected date; changing one updates the other and all queries.

## 💡 Tips & Edge Cases

- Multi-select is desktop-first: use the shortcut above when you need to bulk encrypt or delete. On touch devices, use the long-press selection affordance instead.
- Use the Decrypt modal when someone shared the key with you—you can preview decrypted content before committing to save it unencrypted.
- If you write daily, set a word goal so the progress bar nudges you toward the streak target. Goals are stored per device, so adjust them separately on mobile if needed.
