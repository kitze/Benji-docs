## ✨ What It Does

Goals gives you a clean, focused space to define important targets you're working toward. Each goal can have a name, emoji, due date, and visibility setting—perfect for tracking life milestones, project deadlines, or personal achievements. Unlike task lists or habit trackers, Goals is designed for high-level targets that represent meaningful outcomes rather than daily actions.

## 🚪 Access & Activation

Enable Goals from `Settings → Features → Goals`. For more details on enabling features, see the [Enabling Features guide](/docs/enabling-features).

## 🧭 Core Workflow

**Creating a Goal:**
1. Open the My Goals page from your navigation menu
2. Click "Add Goal"
3. Enter a goal name (required)
4. Pick an emoji to visually identify your goal (optional—defaults to 🎯 if not set)
5. Set a due date if you want to track when you want to complete it (optional)
6. Toggle "Public" if you want the goal to appear on your profile (off by default)
7. Save to create your goal

**Managing Goals:**
- **Edit:** Hover over any goal card and click the three-dot menu to edit details
- **Delete:** Use the same menu to delete individual goals
- **Bulk Delete:** Use the multiselect option to delete multiple goals at once
- **Search:** Filter goals by name using the search bar at the top of the page

Goals automatically sort by due date, with dated goals appearing first and undated goals appearing below.

## ⚙️ Settings Inside the Feature

Each goal has a **Public** toggle that controls whether it appears on your profile. By default, all goals are private and only visible to you. When you mark a goal as public, it will display in a Goals widget on your public profile page at `/u/[your-username]`, showing the goal's name, emoji, and due date to anyone who visits your profile.

## 📊 Widgets & Dashboards

**Goals Widget on My Day:**
- Shows all your goals sorted by due date
- Displays each goal's emoji, name, and formatted due date (e.g., "Jan 15")
- Goals without due dates appear at the bottom of the list
- Clicking the widget title navigates to your full Goals page
- When you have no goals, displays "You don't have any goals yet."

**Adding the Widget:**
1. Navigate to your My Day dashboard
2. Click the customize/add widget button
3. Find Goals under the Productivity section
4. Add it to your dashboard

**Profile Display:**
Public goals automatically appear in a Goals widget on your profile page, visible to anyone who visits.

## 🔐 Privacy

Goals are **private by default**—only you can see them unless you explicitly mark them as public. Each goal has its own visibility toggle, so you can choose which goals to share on your profile and which to keep private.

Unlike some other features, Goals doesn't have global privacy settings. Visibility is controlled individually per goal using the "Public" checkbox when creating or editing.

## 💡 Tips & Edge Cases

**Organizing Your Goals:**
- Use emojis to make goals instantly recognizable at a glance
- Set due dates even for flexible goals—it helps with prioritization
- Keep goal names action-oriented (e.g., "Launch side project" vs. "Side project")

**Bulk Management:**
- When spring cleaning your goal list, use multiselect to delete outdated goals in one action
- The search function is handy when you have many goals and want to find specific ones quickly

**Public Sharing:**
- Public goals show on your profile in due date order, creating a snapshot of what you're working toward
- Consider which goals feel meaningful to share—public goals can spark conversations with followers

**Due Date Sorting:**
- Goals with due dates always appear before undated goals
- If you want a goal to appear at the top of your list, give it a near-term due date
- Undated goals work well for ongoing aspirations without specific deadlines
