## ✨ What It Does

Workouts is your training journal. Start a session, add the movements you intend to hit, log every set with weight, reps, and RPE, then finish to lock in the results. You can duplicate old workouts when you want a proven template, manage your personal exercise library, and surface break-time drills to stay loose between Pomodoros.

## 🚪 Access & Activation

- Enable **Workouts** from `Settings → Features → Workouts` (Pro). This adds the Workouts page, the dedicated “current workout” view, and the exercise library.
- Use the Quick Add dialog (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + A`) or the command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K → Start a new workout`) to launch a fresh session without hunting through menus.

## 🧭 Core Workflow

- Start a workout from the Workouts page or via Spotlight; Benji creates an in-progress session and drops you into the Workout in Progress view.
- Add movements from your library with **Add Exercise** or create a custom movement on the fly. Sets update live—track weight, reps, RPE, and mark them complete as you go.
- Group supersets or circuits by assigning letters, duplicate sets for repeat efforts, and use the built-in plate calculator when you need loading guidance.
- Finish the session when you’re done; Benji records `endedAt`, adds the workout to history, and triggers a “Workout Completed” timeline post with your privacy settings.
- Prefer to log after the fact? Use **Log completed workout** from the Workouts list or Quick Add to create a finished workout with start/end times and notes.

## 🛠️ In-Feature Settings

- **Workouts list**: shows the active workout (if any) plus recent history. Search, multi-select, or duplicate and start any past workout in one click. Cards surface muscles worked and exercise counts.
- **Workout sidebar**: date picker highlights days you trained; clicking a dot opens the workout detail page. Buttons let you jump straight to the exercise library or start a new session.
- **Workout detail**: view every exercise instance and set, including supersets and warm-ups. Context menus let you edit, duplicate, or delete items without leaving the page.
- **Exercise library**: two tabs separate your personal exercises from platform presets. Each exercise stores notes, media, muscle groups, and a **Show during break** toggle that feeds the Break Exercise widget.
- **Current workout view**: manage the live session with headers showing elapsed time, quick actions to finish or cancel, exercise pickers, and per-set tools (duplicate, edit, remove).

## 🔐 Global Settings & Privacy

- `Settings → Privacy → Workouts` controls who can view your workout timeline posts and detail pages (defaults to `Private`).
- Public profile widgets respect this setting; if you restrict workouts to yourself, nobody else sees the counts or completed sessions.

## 📊 Widgets & Dashboards

- **Break Exercise widget** (My Day): rotates through exercises flagged **Show during break**, perfect for mobility or activation between Pomodoros.
- **User profile widget** (`/u/[username]`): highlights recent workouts for viewers who have access, pulling data straight from the Workouts history.

## ⚡ Alfred & Quick Actions

- `Cmd/Ctrl + K → Start a new workout`: begins an in-progress session with your default name.
- `Cmd/Ctrl + K → Log completed workout`: opens the CRUD form so you can backfill a finished session.
- `Cmd/Ctrl + K → Manage workout exercises`: jumps straight to the exercise library.

## 🏆 Timeline & Points

- Finishing a workout creates a `WorkoutCompleted` timeline post and awards **15 leaderboard points**.
- Cancelling a workout removes the in-progress record and skips the timeline update, so only completed sessions affect points.

## 🔗 Integrations & Dependencies

- Exercises marked **Show during break** feed the Break Exercise widget, keeping recovery drills front and center.
- Start or log sessions directly from Quick Add and Spotlight, so workouts slot into the same capture flow as todos and meals.
- Duplication copies every exercise and set, resetting completion state so recurring programs are only a click away.
- The “Workout in progress” card on the Workouts list and the dedicated `/my/workouts/current` page both read the same active session, so you can jump back into logging from desktop or mobile.

## 💡 Tips & Edge Cases

- Name workouts after the focus (“Pull Hypertrophy”, “Tempo Run Prep”) so you can find them quickly with the list search.
- Use letters to group supersets or giant sets; Benji keeps the ordering clear on both desktop and mobile.
- Mark sets as warm-up, drop set, or failure to track intent; filtering by type makes post-session analysis easier.
- Leaving a workout without finishing keeps it in-progress—finish or cancel explicitly if you don’t want it lingering in history.
