## ✨ What It Does

Shopping transforms meal planning into organized grocery lists with automatic ingredient aggregation. Select which meals you're cooking this week, and Shopping combines all recipe ingredients into a single, categorized list—automatically combining quantities when the same ingredient appears in multiple recipes. As you shop, mark items as purchased or flag hard-to-find items. The feature organizes everything with visual categories, emoji icons, and smart AI assistance for categorization. Perfect for weekly meal prep, shared household shopping, or maintaining a running inventory of pantry staples.

## 🚪 Access & Activation

Enable Shopping from `Settings → Features → Shopping`, then access it via **Meals & Shopping → Shopping** in your navigation. For more details on enabling features, see the [Enabling Features guide](/docs/enabling-features).

### 📦 Organizing Items by Status

Shopping divides items into three sections:

**"To buy"** - Items you need to purchase
- This is where new items start
- Your active shopping list

**"Bought"** - Items you've acquired
- Successfully purchased items
- In stock at home

**"Cannot find"** - Items that are difficult to locate
- Mark items stores don't carry
- Saves time on future shopping trips
- Flag for alternative sourcing

### ✅ Marking Items While Shopping

- **Left-click** any item in "To buy" → moves to "Bought"
- **Left-click** any item in "Bought" → moves back to "To buy"
- **Ctrl/Cmd+Click** item in "To buy" → moves to "Cannot find"

## 🔗 Integrations & Dependencies

### 🍳 Meal Planning Connection

Shopping deeply integrates with Meal Planning:

1. **Plan your meals** in the Meal Plan calendar
2. **Generate shopping list** aggregates all recipe ingredients
3. **Quantities combine automatically**:
   - Recipe A needs 2 tablespoons olive oil
   - Recipe B needs 1 tablespoon olive oil
   - Shopping list shows: 3 tablespoons olive oil
4. **Sub-recipes included**: If a recipe uses another recipe as an ingredient, all nested ingredients are captured

This eliminates manual ingredient counting and ensures you buy exactly what you need for the week.

### 📋 Ingredient Lists

Organize items into named lists:
- Filter your shopping view by list
- Share specific lists with household members
- Keep different shopping contexts separate

### 🏷️ Shopping Categories

15 built-in categories with emoji icons:
- 🍎 Fruits
- 🥕 Vegetables
- 🥩 Meat
- 🥛 Dairy
- 🌾 Grains
- 🥫 Pantry
- 🍿 Snacks
- ☕ Beverages
- 🧊 Frozen
- 🧁 Bakery
- 🧂 Spices

## 🔐 Privacy

Shopping data is private by default. You control sharing through **Ingredient Lists**:

- **Private lists**: Only visible to you
- **Shared lists**: Invite specific people to view and edit
- **Real-time collaboration**: When shopping together mode is enabled, all members see live updates
- **No public sharing**: Shopping lists never appear on public profiles or timelines

Share ingredient lists with roommates, family members, or anyone you shop with regularly.

## 💡 Tips & Edge Cases

**Meal Plan Workflow:**
- Plan your entire week of meals before generating the shopping list—it's much more efficient than generating multiple times
- Review the preview panel before adding items to catch any ingredients you already have
- Uncheck days if you're eating out or have leftovers planned
- Sub-recipes automatically expand, so you don't need to manually trace nested ingredients

**Category Organization:**
- Reorder categories to match your store's layout for faster shopping
- Use Category sort mode when shopping to move through the store systematically
- Use Alphabetical mode when checking if you have something at home
- AI category suggestions work best after you've categorized a few items manually (it learns your patterns)

**Status Management:**
- Use "Cannot find" for specialty items that require online ordering or different stores
- Mark pantry staples as "always need at home" to maintain a running staples list
- Items in "Bought" stay there until you move them back to "To buy" for next time

**Shopping Together Mode:**
- Enable "Together" mode before heading to the store with a partner
- One person can manage the list remotely while the other shops
- Refresh happens every 10 seconds—no need to manually refresh
- Perfect for "Did you get milk?" scenarios while shopping

**Revision Screen Efficiency:**
- Use Revision mode to quickly review a long list before shopping
- Filter to "always at home" items to rapidly stock-check pantry staples
- Swipe left for items you have, right for items you need
- Progress tracker keeps you motivated through long lists

**List Management:**
- Create separate lists for different stores (Trader Joe's, Costco, Farmers Market)
- Use the filter checkboxes to focus on one store at a time
- Share household supply lists with roommates so everyone can add items
- Keep a "Someday" list for items you want to try but don't need this week

**AI Assistance:**
- Use "Generate custom" with specific prompts: "Italian dinner party for 8" or "Breakfast meal prep for the week"
- Run "Find missing emoji" periodically to keep your list visually organized
- Let AI suggest categories in bulk rather than doing it one-by-one
- Generate common items when setting up Shopping for the first time

**Mobile Shopping:**
- Long-press is faster than opening menus on mobile
- Single tap toggles between "To buy" and "Bought" for quick marking
- Use your phone's brightness boost feature in dim stores
- Enable "Together" mode so your list updates live while family members add items from home

**Quantity Aggregation:**
- When generating from meal plans, identical ingredients combine automatically
- Different units don't combine (2 tablespoons + 1 cup won't merge)
- Review aggregated quantities in the preview before adding to avoid over-buying
- Adjust recipe serving sizes in meal plan before generating to scale ingredient quantities
