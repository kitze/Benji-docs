## ‚ú® What It Does

Medication keeps your entire medication regimen organized‚Äîfrom adding new medications to tracking prescriptions with specific requirements and logging every dose you take. Set up medications once with dosage details and food interaction rules, create prescriptions for time-bound treatment plans, define requirements for exact timing and amounts, then log your intake with quick-tap buttons that capture whether you took it, skipped it, or missed it entirely. The feature eliminates guesswork around "did I take that pill?" and surfaces your adherence history on your timeline.

## üö™ Access & Activation

The Medication feature is accessible from the Medicine section in your sidebar. Navigate to `Medicine ‚Üí Medicine` to manage your medication list, view prescriptions, and log intake.

## üìä Widgets & Dashboards

The Medication feature doesn't have dedicated dashboard widgets, but integrates with other surfaces:

- Every medication log you create posts to your timeline automatically
- Timeline posts display with a green pill icon and show the medication name plus dosage
- Each log awards **1 point** to the leaderboard under the "Medication logs" point system

## üîó Integrations & Dependencies

### AI Integration

The Medication feature has deep AI integration:

- **Smart logging**: When you tell the AI you took a medication, it automatically links logs to active prescriptions and requirements when applicable

### Timezone Handling

All timestamps adjust to your configured timezone, so medication logs display correctly regardless of when you traveled or changed your timezone setting.

### My Day Integration

Today's medication logs appear in your My Day view alongside other daily activities, providing a complete picture of your day.

## üí° Tips & Edge Cases

- **Use requirements for structured regimens**: If you take medication at consistent times, create requirements instead of manually logging each dose‚Äîyou'll get quick-tap buttons to log with one click
- **Status tracking matters**: Use Taken/Skipped/Missed status to track adherence patterns. Skipped means intentional (e.g., doctor's advice), while Missed indicates forgetting
- **One-off medications**: For medications you take occasionally without a prescription schedule, log them directly without creating prescriptions or requirements
- **Dosage variations**: If you take a different amount than usual, log it manually and adjust the dosage field‚Äîyour requirement's dosage won't change
- **AI-powered setup**: Use the Ask AI button when adding new medications to save time researching proper usage and food interactions
- **End dates for temporary treatments**: Set an end date on prescriptions for antibiotics or short-term treatments, but leave it blank for ongoing medications like daily vitamins
- **Prescription overlap**: You can have multiple active prescriptions for the same medication if your dosage changes‚Äîjust create a new prescription with a new start date
- **Search by content**: Use the search bar in logs to find specific notes or dosage amounts when reviewing your medication history
