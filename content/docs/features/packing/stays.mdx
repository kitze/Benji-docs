## ✨ What It Does

Stays keep all of your lodging details—dates, addresses, confirmation notes—in one hub. Add hotels, apartments, or friends’ guest rooms so every trip shows exactly where you’ll sleep and whether it’s booked.

## 🚪 Access & Activation

- Enable **Packing** from `Settings → Features → Packing` to surface the Stays page in the packing sidebar.
- After enabling, refresh once if the navigation doesn’t immediately show the new entry.

## 🧭 Core Workflow

- The **Stays** list displays every booking with its address, booking badge, and date range. Use the search bar to filter by name, location, or notes.
- Click **Add Stay** to capture a new reservation. Save once you’ve filled in the essentials and the card appears in the grid.
- Select multiple stays to reveal the bulk toolbar for quick delete while you’re tidying old trips.
- Open any stay to edit details, mark it booked/unbooked, or remove it entirely.

## 🛠️ In-Feature Settings

- The stay form collects:
  - Name (required) with optional notes for confirmation numbers or reminders.
  - Location/address text area so directions are a tap away.
  - **Booked** toggle to signal whether the reservation is locked in.
  - Start and end date pickers; leave either blank for open-ended stays.

## ⚡ Alfred & Quick Actions

- `Cmd/Ctrl + K` exposes shortcuts to **Create a new stay** and navigate directly to the Stays page.
- When you’re inside Trips, you can add a stay from the trip sidebar, which launches the same form without leaving the dashboard.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd/Ctrl + K`: open Spotlight to create or jump to a stay instantly.

## 🔗 Integrations & Dependencies

- Trips reference the same stay records you manage here—add or edit a stay from either surface and the itinerary stays in sync.
- Stays can be assigned to trips as inbound/outbound lodging, so keeping dates accurate helps the travel timeline display the right segments.

## 💡 Tips & Edge Cases

- Add unbooked options with specific notes (“awaiting approval”) so you remember what’s pending during planning.
- Use separate stays for split lodging within a single trip—Benji handles overlapping dates cleanly.
- If you’re reusing an old itinerary, duplicate the trip, then adjust the linked stays instead of rebuilding them from scratch.
