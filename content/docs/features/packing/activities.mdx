## ✨ What It Does

Packing activities are the connective tissue between your reusable gear library and each trip. Build a catalog of scenarios—“City sightseeing,” “Trail run,” “Client offsite”—and attach them to packing items so Benji knows exactly which gear belongs when a trip includes that activity.

## 🚪 Access & Activation

- Turn on **Packing** in `Settings → Features → Packing`; the Trip Activities page appears in the packing sidebar alongside items, transports, and stays.
- Refresh once after enabling if the navigation tree doesn’t update immediately.

## 🧭 Core Workflow

- Open **Trip Activities** to see every activity in a searchable list. Use the search bar or emoji to scan at a glance.
- Click **Add Activity** to create a new entry with a name (and optionally an emoji). The list updates the moment you save.
- Select one or more cards to reveal the multi-select toolbar for bulk delete—handy when pruning old scenarios.
- Use the card menu to rename an activity or remove it when it’s no longer needed.

## 🛠️ In-Feature Settings

- The create/edit form collects a required name with an optional emoji picker inline.
- Activities stay lightweight on purpose; there are no dates or owners to manage, just the metadata that powers packing suggestions.

## ⚡ Alfred & Quick Actions

- `Cmd/Ctrl + K` exposes **Create a new packing activity** and navigational shortcuts to the Trip Activities page.
- The Packing Items form also offers inline “Create activity” so you can add a new scenario without leaving your flow.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd/Ctrl + K`: open Spotlight to create or jump to a packing activity instantly.

## 🏆 Timeline & Points

- Activities are internal scaffolding only—they don’t post to the timeline or influence leaderboard points.

## 🔗 Integrations & Dependencies

- Packing items can reference multiple activities; when you start packing a trip, every activity you include pulls in the exact gear mapped here.
- Trips and the charging board read the same activity assignments, so keeping names consistent prevents duplicate scenarios.

## 💡 Tips & Edge Cases

- Keep activity names actionable (“Trail Run – Cold Weather”) so you can tell similar scenarios apart when selecting them for a trip.
- Use emoji categories to visually group activities (🥾 for outdoor, 💼 for work) and make the packing list easier to scan.
- When you retire an activity, bulk edit its related items first to avoid unexpected checklist gaps on future trips.
