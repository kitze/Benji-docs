## ✨ What It Does

Transports log the moving parts of your travel—flights, trains, ferries, rental cars—so you always know where to be and when. Store departure/arrival details, seats, and prep reminders to keep every leg on time.

## 🚪 Access & Activation

Enable Packing from `Settings → Features → Packing`. See the [Enabling Features guide](/docs/enabling-features) for details on feature toggles and visibility options.

## 🧭 Core Workflow

- The **Transports** list shows each leg with its method, departure time, and route. Use the search bar to filter by origin, destination, notes, or seat.
- Tap **Add Transport** to capture a new leg. Save it as soon as you have the basics—name, method, and dates—and refine the rest later.
- Select multiple transports for the multi-select toolbar when you need to delete several outdated legs at once.
- Open any card to edit dates, change the method, update notes, or mark it booked.

## 🛠️ In-Feature Settings

- The transport form collects:
  - Name (required) plus **Type** (Plane, Train, Ferry, Car, etc.) so timelines read naturally.
  - Start/end date and time pickers for precise schedules.
  - Freeform notes and optional from/to address fields for terminals, pick-up spots, or confirmation snippets.
  - **Arrive time before** duration picker to note the buffer you need before departure (e.g., arrive 2 hours before a flight).
  - Seat field and **Booked** toggle.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd/Ctrl + K`: open Alfred to access Transports commands

## 🔗 Integrations & Dependencies

- Trips render transports on the travel timeline; keeping start/end times accurate drives the timeline pills and countdowns.
- Store the **Arrive time before** buffer so you remember the lead time required when reviewing the trip itinerary.
- Changes you make from this page or the trip sidebar edit the same transport records, keeping every surface aligned.

## 💡 Tips & Edge Cases

- Use descriptive names (“Flight UA 213 → NYC”) so the trip overview stays readable on mobile.
- Set different transports for outbound and return legs—even with the same carrier—so you can tweak seats or arrival buffers independently.
- When plans change, duplicate a transport to keep history, then mark the original as unbooked or delete it after the trip wraps.
