## ✨ What It Does

Packing keeps every item you might take on a trip—laptop charger, hiking boots, passport—in a single library. Tag items with useful metadata (essentials, charging needs, morning-of reminders) so every trip checklist is accurate with almost no manual work.

## 🚪 Access & Activation

- Enable Packing from `Settings → Features → Packing` to add **Packing items**, **Packing activities**, **Transports**, and related sections to your sidebar/mobile toolbar.
- Refresh once after toggling to make sure the new pages show up in navigation.

## 🧭 Core Workflow

- Open **Packing items** to see your master list. Use the search bar for quick filtering and **Add item** to capture something new.
- Each item card shows emoji/name, description, and badges for flags like “Essential,” “Needs charging,” “Expendable,” or “Double check.”
- Associate items with **Packing activities** (e.g., “Skiing,” “Gym”) so trips that include those activities pull the right gear.
- Multi-select header tools let you bulk delete or edit when you’re cleaning up the list.

## 🛠️ In-Feature Settings

- The item form includes:
  - Emoji + name + description.
  - Activity multi-select (with inline creation) so you can tie the item to specific trip contexts.
  - Flags:
    - **Essential** → always included when you generate packing for a trip.
    - **Expendable** → reminds you it may need re-purchasing each trip.
    - **Needs charging** → surfaces in the trip charging board until marked Charged.
    - **Needs to be double checked** → keeps it prominent for day-of review.
  - `Charging status` (Not charged → Charging → Charged) to track progress even outside the trip board.
  - `When to pack` (e.g., NightBefore, InTheMorning) so the trip filters can show morning-only items.

## ⚡ Alfred & Quick Actions

- Spotlight (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`) offers:
  - **Create a new packing item**.
  - **Create a new packing activity**.
  - Navigation shortcuts to the Packing pages.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd/Ctrl + K`: jump into Spotlight to add items or activities from anywhere.
- Within a trip’s packing board, use the action buttons to mark items packed/charging/charged—the board updates instantly.

## 🏆 Timeline & Points

- Packing status changes stay within your trip planning, leaving the timeline and leaderboard untouched.

## 🔗 Integrations & Dependencies

- Trips use packing items in two ways:
  - All **essential** items get pulled into every trip automatically.
  - Items tagged with a trip’s selected activities are added when you press **Start packing**.
- The trip charging board only shows items marked **Needs charging**, using your per-item charging status to track progress.
- Packing activities serve as reusable templates; you can create them on the fly from the item form or via Spotlight.

## 💡 Tips & Edge Cases

- Give essentials neutral colors/emojis and reserve bold icons for activity-specific items to scan faster.
- Use the `When to pack` field to keep “morning-only” items out of the main queue until departure day.
- After a trip, reset charging statuses so future packing runs start fresh—either from the packing board or directly on the item.
