## ‚ú® What It Does

Contacts helps you maintain meaningful relationships by tracking the people in your life and reminding you when it's time to reconnect. Whether it's family, friends, colleagues, or romantic partners, Contacts keeps your relationships organized and surfaces who needs your attention based on how often you want to stay in touch.

You can add anyone‚Äîwhether they use Benji or not‚Äîset custom check-in intervals, and let the home widget gently nudge you when enough time has passed since your last interaction. Pin your most important people to always keep them visible, track birthdays in your planner, and associate contacts with activities and locations to build a rich history of your connections.

## üö™ Access & Activation

Enable **Contacts** from `Settings ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Contacts`. For more details about enabling features, see the [Enabling Features guide](/docs/enabling-features).

## üß≠ Core Workflow

### Adding Contacts

Create contacts in two ways:

1. **New Contact** ‚Äî Add anyone, whether they use Benji or not:
   - Enter their name (required)
   - Select relationship type (required): family, friend, colleague, romantic partner, etc.
   - Optionally add birthday, address, email, phone, and avatar

2. **Link Benji User** ‚Äî Connect to someone who already has a Benji account:
   - Choose from your followers or people you follow
   - Their profile info (name, avatar, email) auto-populates
   - Select your relationship type to complete the connection

### Setting Interaction Intervals

For each contact, set a **day interval**‚Äîhow many days should pass before you reconnect. The home widget tracks your last activity with each person and surfaces them when the interval is exceeded. If you log an activity, plan an event, or otherwise interact with that contact in Benji, the timer resets.

### Organizing Your Contacts

Browse your contacts list with:
- **Search**: Find contacts by name, email, or phone
- **Grouping**: View by relationship type (default) or activity status
- **Multi-select**: Perform bulk actions when needed

Each contact displays their avatar, name, relationship type, and time since last activity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings Inside the Feature

When creating or editing a contact, configure:

- **Name** ‚Äî Required for all contacts
- **Relationship Type** ‚Äî Choose from 25 options including girlfriend, boyfriend, friend, husband, wife, family members (mother, father, sibling, grandparent, etc.), cousin, aunt, uncle, colleague, acquaintance, or other
- **Day Interval** ‚Äî How often (in days) you want to interact with this person; triggers widget reminders when exceeded
- **Pinned** ‚Äî Pin contacts to always show in the home widget regardless of when you last connected
- **Birthday** ‚Äî Date picker for birthday; creates yearly recurring events in your planner
- **Avatar** ‚Äî Upload a photo for new contacts (auto-populated for Benji users)
- **Address, Email, Phone** ‚Äî Optional contact details
- **Show in Weeks of Life** ‚Äî Include this contact's birthday events in your Weeks of Life visualization (requires Weeks of Life feature)

**Day Interval Logic**: The widget shows a contact when days since last activity meet or exceed the configured interval, or if the contact is pinned. This creates a flexible reminder system that adapts to each relationship's needs.

## üìä Widgets & Dashboards

### Home Screen Widget

The Contacts widget appears on your **My Day** dashboard and shows:
- Contacts who need attention based on their day interval setting
- Pinned contacts (always visible)
- First names with time since last activity (e.g., "3 days ago", "1 week ago")
- Avatar thumbnails for quick recognition
- "You're caught up with everyone!" when no one needs attention

Click any contact to jump to their detail page.

**Adding the Widget**: Enable the Contacts widget from `Settings ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Contacts` when you first activate the feature, or manage home widgets from your My Day dashboard.

## ‚ö° Alfred & Quick Actions

For more about Alfred and Spotlight, see the [Alfred & Spotlight guide](/docs/alfred-spotlight).

**Contacts-specific commands:**
- **"Create a new contact"** ‚Äî Opens the contact creation form
- **Search for contacts** ‚Äî Type a contact's name in Alfred to quickly navigate to their detail page

Access Alfred with `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux).

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

Contacts doesn't have dedicated keyboard shortcuts. Use **Alfred/Spotlight** (`Cmd+K` or `Ctrl+K`) to quickly create or search for contacts.

Other relevant global shortcuts:
- `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` ‚Äî Open Alfred/Spotlight to search contacts or create new ones

## üèÜ Timeline, Points & Privacy

**No timeline posts or points**: Contact interactions are private by default. When you log activities, plan events, or track time with contacts, those records remain personal and don't post to your public timeline or award points.

**Privacy by design**: Each contact relationship is tied to your account. Even when a contact is shared between multiple users (for example, if two Benji users both track the same mutual friend), each person maintains their own relationship settings, intervals, and activity history. Deleting your relationship with a contact doesn't affect other users' connections.

## üîó Integrations & Dependencies

### Planner Integration

**Birthdays**: When you add a birthday to a contact, Benji automatically creates a yearly recurring event in your planner. These birthday events appear on the calendar so you'll never miss an important date.

**Event Linking**: Attach contacts to any planner event‚Äîlunches, meetings, trips‚Äîto associate them with your schedule. This helps track when you last spent time together and feeds into the interaction reminder system.

### Activity Logs

Contacts integrate with activity logs throughout Benji. When you log activities (like visiting a location, attending an event, or tracking time), you can tag multiple contacts. These logs update the "last activity" timestamp for each person, resetting their day interval reminder.

### Weeks of Life

Enable **"Show in Weeks of Life"** on a contact to include their birthday events in your Weeks of Life visualization. This adds a personal touch to your life timeline by marking important birthdays over the years.

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

**Pin your VIPs**: Use the pin feature for your most important relationships‚Äîpartner, immediate family, closest friends‚Äîso they always appear in the home widget regardless of interaction frequency.

**Adjust intervals by relationship type**: Set shorter intervals (3-7 days) for close friends and family, longer intervals (14-30 days) for extended family or colleagues, and even longer intervals (60-90 days) for acquaintances you want to remember but don't need to contact often.

**Link Benji users when possible**: If your contact has a Benji account, link to their user profile instead of creating a separate contact. This auto-syncs their name and avatar if they update their profile.

**Combine with the planner**: Schedule recurring catch-up events in your planner and attach the relevant contact. This creates a structured system for maintaining relationships alongside the organic reminders from the widget.

**Track group activities**: When logging activities with multiple people, tag all relevant contacts. This accurately reflects when you interacted with each person, even if it was in a group setting.

**Use birthdays strategically**: Even if you don't celebrate every birthday, adding them creates helpful planner events and ensures you're aware when someone's special day is approaching.
