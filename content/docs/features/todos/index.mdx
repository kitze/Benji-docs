## ✨ What It Does

Todos is the backbone for everything you promise yourself (or your team). It gives you lightning-fast capture, deep task metadata, and multiple planning views so you can shuffle work between inbox, Today, Tomorrow, or longer horizons without losing context. Lists and Projects add structure on top, but the Todos page is where every idea, follow-up, and recurring chore lands first.

## 🚪 Access & Activation

Enable Todos from `Settings → Features → Todos`. See the [Enabling Features guide](/docs/enabling-features) for details on feature toggles and visibility options.

Choose your default landing screen in the same settings panel (Overview, Today, Tomorrow, Inbox, or Upcoming). Benji remembers this per device. The task-type toggle (Both / Personal / Work) sits in the upper left of every Todos view and persists per device so you can focus on the right stream.

## 🧭 Core Workflow

- **Quick capture everywhere**  
  Press `q` (or tap the floating add button on mobile) to drop a task without leaving the current view. Quick add inherits context automatically: the bucket you’re viewing, the list or project section you’re inside, the active task type, and—as long as you’re on Upcoming or Planner—the target date.

- **Full detail editing**  
  Open any task to edit emoji, description, links, location, wait status (with reason), privacy, start/planned/due dates, recurrence, time of day, estimated duration, working hours, annoying level, tags, assignees, parent list, parent project, and blocking dependencies. Subtasks can run sequentially or in parallel, and you get revision history plus inline comments for audit trails.

- **Working the list**  
  Check off tasks to complete them, or use the hover bar for “Plan for today/tomorrow”, clear dates, start a Pomodoro, duplicate, or delete. Recurring tasks advance automatically and drop their old Planner events so you aren’t juggling stale reminders.

- **Power menu & pinning**  
  Hotkeys (`D`, `P`, `T`, `J`, `L`, `A`) open the action menu so you can update due dates, planned dates, tags, projects, lists, assignees, or priority without touching the mouse. Pin a task to the top of the view or to the desktop menubar when it needs constant visibility (only one task can be menu-bar pinned at a time).

- **Bulk edits**  
  Multi-select with `Cmd/Ctrl + Click` to reveal a toolbar for bulk complete, replan, clear dates, move to another list/project, or delete. Benji immediately clears the selection to avoid accidental repeats.

- **Collaboration & triage**  
  Clicking the avatar stack opens assignee management; `Cmd/Ctrl + Click` adds or removes yourself instantly. Waiting tasks show a yellow chip (Alt-click clears it), and anything blocked by another todo auto-migrates into the “Can’t be started” group until the dependency clears.

## ⚙️ Settings Inside the Feature

- **Filtering & search**  
  The filter popover offers toggles for only mandatory todos, points range (Overview), show private tasks, show creator, group-by options (time block, priority, tag group), and view-specific time-of-day filters (with an `Auto` mode that hides tasks outside the current cycle). Use the inline search bar to narrow results without leaving the page.

- **View controls**  
  Overview includes pinned, overdue, waiting, inbox, Today, Tomorrow, upcoming buckets, blocked items, recurring templates, paused tasks, and anything delegated. Day/Upcoming views collapse completed sections automatically and honour time-of-day groupings. Planner syncs with calendar mode so you can drag tasks onto dedicated time blocks.

- **Sidebar panels**  
  The Lists and Projects trays sit beside Todos for quick navigation; both expose invitation counts and “Start from template” options when you need new structure on the fly.

## 🔐 Global Settings & Privacy

- Task privacy defaults to **Private** but can be changed per task (`Private`, `Followers`, `Public`). The global **Show private todos** filter controls whether private titles appear in shared contexts.
- Badge counts, default subtask behaviour, whether completed subtasks keep parents visible, and the Today widget toggles all live in `Settings → Features → Todos`.

## 📊 Widgets & Dashboards

- **Today widget** (Home/My Day): enable in settings to pin a condensed view of Today, overdue, and completed tasks with quick add right from your dashboard.
- **Summary stats**: completed todo counts surface alongside other metrics on the Summary page.
- **Planner integration**: planned dates and time-of-day values drop todos into Weekly and calendar views with drag-and-drop rescheduling.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- `q`: focus quick add
- `Cmd/Ctrl + K`: open Alfred to access Todos commands
- `Alt + P`: open Planner Day view
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`: save edits in the task modal
- `D`, `P`, `T`, `J`, `L`, `A`: jump directly to due date, planned date, tag, project, list, or assignee pickers on the highlighted task
- `Shift + Click`: extend selections down the list; `Esc` clears selections

## 🏆 Timeline & Points

- Completing a todo logs it in the Completed Todo Log and awards **5 leaderboard points** plus weighting from priority, due date proximity, annoying level, mandatory flag, or list/project modifiers.
- Todos stay off the public timeline unless you share them manually (via Lists/Projects or explicit timeline posts).

## 🔗 Integrations & Dependencies

- Start a Pomodoro from any task; the active pomodoro dialog pulls in the task list so you can clear subtasks while the timer runs.
- Planner drag-and-drop keeps todos and calendar events in sync—moving a task in Planner updates the planned date/time-of-day everywhere.
- Lists and Projects apply default tags, assignees, and point weighting to their tasks, maintaining consistent scoring across the workspace.
- Waiting tasks and dependencies feed the Overview buckets so you see exactly what’s blocked and why.

## 💡 Tips & Edge Cases

- Use waiting status (with a reason) instead of comments when you’re blocked; the yellow chip keeps the task visible and filterable.
- Pinned tasks stay at the top of Overview or Today even when you switch between Personal/Work, so pin the one thing you refuse to ignore.
- Recurrent templates live in the Recurring bucket—edit them there to change future instances without touching completed history.
- Menu-bar pinning is designed for single-focus work. As soon as you pin a different task, the previous one is unpinned automatically.
