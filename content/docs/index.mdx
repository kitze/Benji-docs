Benji keeps your everyday routines, logs, and automations in one place so you can focus on momentum instead of maintenance. These docs highlight the user-facing features that make Benji feel effortless—and track which areas already have deep dives versus ones we still need to document.

## How to Use These Docs

- Start with the feature pages to understand what each area helps you accomplish.
- Look for callouts that explain how Benji keeps everything feeling smooth in real-world use.
- Expect concrete details about settings, automations, and privacy so you know exactly what the feature delivers.
