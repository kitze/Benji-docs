## Why Routines Matter

Habits keep you consistent, but routines string those habits and extra steps into a playbook. A morning routine might combine “Water plants”, “Journal”, and “Review calendar”; an evening routine could walk you through shutdown tasks plus a short reflection. Benji routines ensure the order, timing, and collaboration stay predictable—and you can run the same flow repeatedly without rebuilding it.

## Access & Activation

- Turn on Routines via `Settings → Features → Routines`, then choose whether to pin it to the sidebar, mobile toolbar, or surface the routines widget on your dashboard.
- Reload once if the page doesn’t appear immediately—the toggle persists per user.

## Building A Routine

- Click **Create routine** to open the form. Set a name and emoji, pick a time of day (Any, Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night), choose the days it should appear (all enabled by default), and optionally start it paused.
- Time-of-day and day selections feed the routine filters so it shows up exactly when you need it—in the list, widget, and player.
- After saving, add steps:
  - **Habit steps** reference existing habits or let you create new ones inline. They inherit habit duration and completion rules.
  - **Custom steps** cover anything else (e.g., “Wipe desk”). They can include their own duration for more precise timing.
- Drag to reorder steps; the editor constantly updates the routine’s total duration so you know how long the full flow takes before scheduling it.

## Collaboration & Sharing

- Open a routine’s menu → **Sharing** to invite teammates. Invited users can play the routine, contribute completions, and see active progress.
- Routine invites surface in the header (desktop) and filters button (mobile) so you can accept or decline on any device.
- Habits inside a shared routine keep their own privacy: assigned habits still belong to their original owners, and completions respect each habit’s privacy setting.

## Running A Routine

- Press **Play** to start (or resume) the routine player. Benji creates an active instance with a progress bar, completed/remaining counts, and quick navigation.
- Use the view toggle:
  - **Player** focuses on the current step with large controls.
  - **List** shows every step so you can mark items non-linearly when you already know the flow.
- Mark steps the same way you log habits:
  - Click for **Done**.
  - `Alt/Option` for **Skip** (or choose Skip in the menu).
  - `Cmd/Ctrl` for **Fail** (also available via menu).
- Habit steps update the underlying habit log in real time; checklist steps simply mark the routine instance. Jump back/forward, or use **Reset** to clear the whole instance without touching the routine definition.
- Golden streaks apply automatically—if you finish every habit in a time slot, the “Share on timeline” prompt appears, obeying your Habits privacy setting.

## Scheduling & Planner Integration

- Routine duration equals the sum of step durations. When you drop a routine onto the planner calendar, Benji blocks out that amount of time so your schedule matches reality.
- Planner events created from routines still link back to the routine player, making it easy to start the flow when the calendar reminder fires.

## Automation & AI

- The routine editor exposes **Generate with AI** (if AI is enabled) to suggest a stack of steps you can refine.
- Routine instances track completion automatically: pausing midway simply preserves progress so you can resume later without losing what’s done.

## Widgets & Dashboards

- **Routines widget** (My Day): shows routines matching the current time (or “Any” time) and lets you launch them instantly. Widget settings let you include/exclude “Any” time routines or show routines created by collaborators.
- Planner cards stick to the same durations you define in the routine editor, so moving routines around keeps the calendar timeline accurate.

## Alfred & Quick Actions

- Alfred includes commands for `Create routine`, opening specific routines, or launching the player. Spotlight also surfaces pending routine invites and recently active runs for fast access.

## Timeline, Points & Privacy

- Habit steps carry their habit point values (custom or punishing). Non-habit steps don’t affect the leaderboard.
- Golden posts generated through routines respect `Settings → Privacy → Habits`. Adjust that setting if you want followers—or everyone—to see your wins.

## Tips & Edge Cases

- Add durations to every step the moment you create it. Accurate durations make routine totals, planner blocks, and stacked flows far more useful.
- Pause routines when you’re iterating; paused routines stay out of the widget and player until you’re ready to reactivate them.
- Use List view in the player when you’re demonstrating the flow to someone else or jumping around during deep work.
- Accept routine invites quickly so teammates know who’s in; the invite badge sticks around until you respond.
- Reset routine instances whenever you want a fresh run—handy after experimentation or when you realise you skipped the flow midstream.
